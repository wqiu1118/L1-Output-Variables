## Python
Python is an object-oriented language

## Output
Output is the way the computer prints information to the user in the "Console"

to output we use `print()`

## Comments
Comments are notes that the compiler skips over

To use comments, we use `#COMMENT` for single-line 

we use `'''COMMENT'''` for block comments

## Data Types

We will be working with 5 main data types 

1. Integer (int) - whole numbers
2. Charater (Char) - a single letter/symbol/number
3. String (str) - Collection of Characters
4. Floating Point (float) - decimal numbers
5. Boolean (bool) - True/False

## Variables 
Variables are containers that hold a value

### Rules for variable names 
1. Always start with a letter  `1name = "Celine"` --> NOT ALLOWED
2. Can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores (_) `my name = "Celine"` --> NOT ALLOWED
3. If more than one word, use camelCase or underscores to seperate words
   `myFirstName` or `my_first_name`

   ## Concatention
   `+` Adding trings together, appending (add to end)

   `"Hello "+ "World" = "Hello World"`

   ## Type Cast
   Forcing a data type on a value

   ### To force an integer into a string
   `str(VariableName)`

   ### To force a tring into an integer
   `int(VariableName)`
